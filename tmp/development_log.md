# Portfolio Website Development Log

## Project Overview
Creating a portfolio website for v7petrov.github.io to showcase cool projects and work.

## Technology Stack Decision
After analyzing requirements, I've decided to use:
- **HTML5** - For semantic structure
- **CSS3** - For modern styling and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - For interactivity without heavy frameworks
- **GitHub Pages** - For hosting (already set up)

**Why this stack?**
- Simple and fast to develop
- No build process needed
- Easy to maintain and update
- Perfect for GitHub Pages hosting
- Lightweight and fast loading
- Easy to customize and extend

## Development Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup
- [x] Created tmp folder for development logs
- [x] Created this development log
- [x] Analyzed current workspace structure

### Step 2: Website Structure Planning
- [x] Create main HTML file (index.html)
- [x] Create CSS file for styling
- [x] Create JavaScript file for interactivity

- [x] Added beautiful loading page with spinner and fallback options
- [x] Organized website structure for development vs. public content

### Step 5: Professional Development Environment Setup
- [x] Created cross-platform development server scripts (dev-server.sh, dev-server.bat)
- [x] Added professional package.json with development scripts
- [x] Implemented proper local HTTP server setup (not file:// protocol)
- [x] Enhanced README.md with comprehensive development instructions
- [x] Added professional project metadata and structure documentation
- [x] Added comprehensive .gitignore for professional development workflow

### Step 3: Features to Implement
- [ ] Responsive navigation bar
- [ ] Hero section
- [ ] About section
- [ ] Projects showcase
- [ ] Contact information
- [ ] Mobile-friendly design

## Notes
- Starting with a simple structure to get the basic layout working
- Will add more sophisticated features incrementally
- Focus on clean, modern design that showcases work effectively

## Files Created

- `portfolio/index.html` - Main HTML structure with navigation and hero section
- `portfolio/styles.css` - Modern CSS with responsive design and gradient backgrounds
- `portfolio/script.js` - JavaScript for smooth scrolling and navigation highlighting
- `dev-server.sh` - Unix/Linux/macOS development server script
- `dev-server.bat` - Windows development server script
- `package.json` - Professional project configuration and scripts
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `.gitignore` - Professional development file exclusions
- `tmp/development_log.md` - This development log

## Current Features
- **Root redirect system** - Automatically sends visitors to portfolio folder
- **Professional loading page** - Beautiful spinner and fallback options during redirect
- **Organized structure** - Development files separate from public portfolio content
- **Portfolio features** - Fixed top navigation bar with gradient background
- **Responsive design** - Works on mobile and desktop

## Recent Implementation Details

### Root Redirect Page (index.html)
**What was implemented:**
- Created a new `index.html` in the root directory that automatically redirects visitors to the portfolio folder
- Added HTML meta refresh for instant redirect: `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=./portfolio/">`
- Implemented JavaScript fallback redirect after 1 second for compatibility
- Designed a beautiful loading page with animated spinner and glassmorphism effects

**Why this approach:**
- **Organization**: Keeps development files, documentation, and other projects in the root directory without exposing them to visitors
- **Professional experience**: Visitors get a smooth, immediate redirect to the actual portfolio
- **Flexibility**: Allows storing non-public content (like this development log, scripts, etc.) in the root
- **Clean URLs**: Main portfolio remains accessible at `v7petrov.github.io/portfolio/` while root redirects seamlessly
- **Fallback safety**: Multiple redirect methods ensure visitors always reach the portfolio
